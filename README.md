# Three.js + WebGPU Post-Processing Effects

In this beginner-friendly project, we'll leverage the WebGPU renderer in Three.js and layer post-processing passes step by step. Along the way weâ€™ll sharpen the essentials like asset loading, TSL operators and animation so you can create amazing 3D on the web. Start here, then level up effect-by-effect. If it helps, drop a sub and explore my other tutorials/resources.
